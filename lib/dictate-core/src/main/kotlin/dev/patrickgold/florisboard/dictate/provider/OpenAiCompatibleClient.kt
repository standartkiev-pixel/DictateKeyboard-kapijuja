/**
 * A single client implementation that talks to any OpenAI Chat Completions / Audio Transcriptions
 * compatible endpoint. This one class covers OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, DeepInfra, Mistral,
 * xAI, DeepSeek, local Ollama and arbitrary custom servers – they only differ by base URL, key and
 * a few headers (see [ProviderRegistry] and [ProviderConfig]).
 *
 * Google Gemini is also handled here: chat/rewording goes through its OpenAI-compatible layer
 * unchanged, while transcription uses the native generateContent endpoint (see
 * [transcribeGeminiGenerateContent]). Providers with a genuinely different chat API (e.g. Anthropic
 * native) would still need their own [LlmProvider] implementation; until then they are reachable via
 * OpenRouter.
