     *
     * Kept here rather than in the file-import screen (where it started) because the recording path
     * needs it too: 16 kHz mono WAV is 32 kB per second, so 25 MB is reached after 13 minutes
     * 39 seconds — which is what made a 14-minute dictation fail outright (#281).
     *
     * Figures read from each provider's own documentation on 2026-08-17:
     *  - OpenAI 25 MB.
     *  - Dictate Cloud 25 MB — but for its own reason, not a borrowed one. The figure used to be
     *    justified as "it proxies to OpenAI, so it inherits the ceiling", and that reasoning has
     *    stopped being true: the server now chooses between two providers per service and the app is
     *    deliberately never told which. What the number has to express is the **server's own
     *    promise**, `MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS` — ten minutes, which at 16 kHz mono WAV is about 19 MB. The
     *    25 MB stays because it is the ceiling the server would reject at, and rejecting is its job:
     *    it answers 413 with `CONTENT_SIZE_LIMIT`, which the app turns into an offer to keep the
     *    recording. A lower figure here would refuse locally what the server would have accepted.
     *  - Groq 25 MB on the free tier, 100 MB on the dev tier. The key does not say which tier it is
     *    on, so the lower one is assumed.
     *  - Gemini caps the whole request at 20 MB, and its audio travels **base64-inline**
     *    (`transcribeGeminiGenerateContent`), which inflates it by 4/3 — so the audio itself may not
     *    exceed about 15 MB. This is the one provider whose limit bites before the general packing
     *    threshold does. The Interactions path taken by the dedicated STT model (#292) documents the
     *    same 20 MB request ceiling and encodes the same way, so the figure covers both.
     *  - ElevenLabs 3 GB, Deepgram 2 GB, AssemblyAI 2.2 GB through the upload endpoint. Far beyond
     *    anything a keyboard produces; recorded so the number is not looked up twice.
     *  - SiliconFlow 50 MB (and one hour), from its transcription API reference.
     *  - OpenRouter 25 MB for a multipart upload, added 2026-09-04 while checking #321 — it was simply
     *    missing, which meant the file-import path never split anything for it and a shared recording
     *    went out whole to be refused. Its harder limit is not a size at all: a request gets about 60
     *    seconds of *processing* time, and that does not convert into an audio length honestly, because
     *    how much speech fits depends on the chosen model's speed rather than on anything we control.
     *  - Mistral and Soniox document a *duration* (3 hours, 300 minutes) but no size, so they stay 0.
     *    Do not translate a duration into bytes here: the encoding is not theirs to assume.
