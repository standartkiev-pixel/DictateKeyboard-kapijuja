     * looking at their own text would count. The same applies to Indic syllables and to combining marks.

     * Words come from the word iterator rather than from splitting at spaces, because Chinese, Japanese
     * and Thai write without them — splitting there returns 1 for a whole paragraph. A segment counts as
     * a word when it holds at least one letter or digit, which keeps punctuation and the spaces
     * themselves out of the total.

     * How well that works for those scripts is the platform's doing: on Android these iterators are
     * ICU-backed and segment by dictionary, while a plain JVM (where the unit tests run) hands back a
     * Chinese sentence as a single word. Hence the tests pin the character count there and only require
     * the word count to be sane.
