/**
 * The mark to show beside a provider, so its row can be found by logo rather than read.
 *
 * Monochrome outlines, drawn in whatever colour the row uses like any other icon here. Each is the
 * provider's own mark, used to identify the service it configures; the trademarks belong to their owners
 * and are credited on the attributions screen.
 *
 * Anything without a mark here — a custom endpoint, say — falls back to the generic cloud this list used
 * throughout before.
