/**
 * Playing back the audio behind a transcript, in one place.
 *
 * Both the history's detail dialog and the import screen (#301) let you listen while reading. The
 * part worth sharing is not the row of buttons but the [MediaPlayer] itself: it has to be paused and
 * resumed without losing its place, seekable, released when the screen goes away, and polled while
 * it runs — a second hand-rolled copy of that is a second place to leak a player.
 *
 * Pause is not stop. The first version released the player on every tap, which meant "pause" threw
 * away the position and the duration with it; this one keeps the player prepared and only lets go on
 * [stop], which the composition calls when it leaves.
