/**
 * The per-provider credential record of the keyring (see [ProviderAccounts]).
 *
 * One [ProviderAccount] holds everything needed to talk to a single provider: its API key, the chosen
 * transcription/chat models and – for user-defined endpoints – a base URL and display name. Built-in
 * providers are keyed by their [ProviderRegistry] id ("openai", "groq", …); custom endpoints get a
 * generated `custom:<uuid>` id so the user can keep several of them side by side.
 *
 * Empty model strings mean "use the provider preset's default model". [cachedModels] is the last
 * fetched `/models` catalog (see [LlmProvider.listModels]) so the model picker is instant and works
 * offline; [cachedModelsAt] is its epoch-millis timestamp for staleness checks.
