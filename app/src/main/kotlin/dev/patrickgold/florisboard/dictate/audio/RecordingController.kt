/**
 * Records microphone audio into a 16 kHz mono PCM16 **WAV** file in the app cache.
 *
 * WAV is used (rather than the previous AAC/m4a) because it is universally accepted by every
 * transcription path — including the multimodal `chat/completions` `input_audio` endpoint (issue #130),
 * which only takes wav/mp3 — and 16 kHz mono is exactly what speech models consume, so there is no
 * quality loss and the payload stays small (~1.9 MB/min). Captured via [AudioRecord]; raw PCM is streamed
 * to the file behind a placeholder header that is patched with the real sizes on [stop], so long
 * recordings never have to be held in memory.
 *
 * Requires the RECORD_AUDIO runtime permission; [start] throws if the microphone cannot be acquired.
