/**
 * The whole press on the mic, from the moment it lands until it lifts (#235).
 *
 * None of this can live in the gesture layer's coroutine. Measured across several builds, Compose ends
 * that coroutine of its own accord part way into a press — sometimes by handing it a synthetic release
 * with the finger unmoved and still pressed, sometimes by cancelling it outright, leaving no trace at
 * all — while the window goes on receiving the real touch until the genuine release seconds later. That
 * is what made the first press after every held recording do nothing: the press was recognised, the
 * overlay windows were even created, and then the coroutine holding the rest of the logic was gone.
 *
 * So the gesture layer only reports that the mic was pressed, and everything after that — the delay that
 * separates a tap from a hold, sliding, latching, releasing — is decided here, driven by [dispatch] from
 * the IME root view and a plain main-thread delay. Thresholds arrive in pixels because this side has no
 * density, and the [QuickAction] comes along so a tap can still be delivered as the ordinary key press.
